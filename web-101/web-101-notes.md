## How does a website works ?

### 2 machines are communicating

- a client (your browser)
- a server

They communicate based on a common protocol : *Hyper Text Transfer Protocol* (HTTP)

### Web != Internet

Internet is the wire and machines connected</br>
Web is the what is transferred using the HTTP</br>
It is thus a subset of the Internet

### HTTP is used to transfer ressources (=files)

It is based on a system of requests of responses between a client and a server.
Anytime a user makes an action on a website it will send a request (GET request) to a server.</br>
In cas of a simple static website the server will just fetch the HTML page and send it to the client.</br>
In case of a more complex dynamic site the sever will build the HTML page to send using the backend of the site.</br>
Then the browser will process the HTML file to display the web page to the user.
